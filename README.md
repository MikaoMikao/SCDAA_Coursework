Hi David,\\
Here is the introduction of how to obtain the results of exercises.
1. The code for all methods in Exercise 1 is in Exercise_1_1_methods.py and the Monte Carlo method which is used in Exercise 3 is also in it.
2. You can run the example for testing the methods in Exercise 1.1 and the Monte Carlo method by running the file Implementation of Ex_1.py
3. The neural networks we used in the Exercise 2 are in Net_DGM class and FFN class and you can get the results in Exercise 2 by running the Implementation of Ex_2
4. The last two exercises can be implemented by running the files: Implementation of Ex_3.py and Implementation of Ex_4.py and the methods they used are in Ex_3.py and Ex_4.py
