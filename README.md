Hi David, \
The code for all methods in Exercise 1 is in Exercise_1_1_methods.py\
and you can run the example and Monte Carlo checks by running the file Implementatino.py\
The neural networks which are used in the Exercise 2 are in Net_DGM class and FFN class\
The last two exercises can be implemented by running the files: Ex_3.py and Ex_4.py\
and the methods they used are in PDE.py\
