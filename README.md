Hi David,    
   
Here is the introduction of how to obtain the results of exercises.

## How to run the codes
1. The code for all methods in Exercise 1 is in `Ex_1_methods.py` and the Monte Carlo method which is used in Exercise 3 is also in it.
2. You can run the example for testing the methods in Exercise 1.1 and Monte Carlo simulations of Exercise 1.2 by running the file `Implementation_of_Ex_1.py`
3. The neural networks we used in the Exercise 2 are in `Ex_2_methods.py` which includes the Net_DGM class and the FFN class and you can get the results in Exercise 2 by running the `Implementation_of_Ex_2.py`
4. The methods for Exercise 3 are in `Ex_3_methods.py` and the results can be reproduced by running the files: `Implementation_of_Ex_3.py`
5. The methods and implementation for Exercise 4 are all in `Ex_4.py`
